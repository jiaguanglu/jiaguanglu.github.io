Hello everyone, I am Ximeng, and major in Mechanical Engineering. My research interests include robotics, control, and mathematics. I got my Bachelor's degree from [Shandong University](https://www.en.sdu.edu.cn/) (SDU) in China in 2022. Then I went to Singapore and got my Master's degree from [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/) (NUS) in 2023. Now I am a Research Engineer at NUS, advised by [Prof. Chirikjian](https://chirikjianlab.github.io/).
