There are three reference frames in the experiment: camera frame, world frame, and foot frame:
![exp1](./exp1.png)

In experiment, Nao moves itself CoP from the middle to the right side by the model-free control method.
![exp2](./exp2.png)

Different postures when the robot moves the CoP to different points on the path.

When the sensor is accurate, the experimental results of running the same path three times.
