* A class of block-shaped ori-blocks was designed, which was kinematic equivalent to classic over-constrained linkages like Bennett linkage, Myard linkage, and Bricard linkage;
* The deployment/grasping motion of a sub-chain was analyzed using the decomposition theorem of the constraint screw system;
* A comprehensive type synthesis method based on reciprocal screw theory was proposed to construct reconfigurable mechanisms;
* A constraint force decomposition theorem was provided to create a family of deployable grasping parallel mechanisms;
* The performance evaluation indexes of mechanisms were analyzed, such as the deploy/fold ratio and stiffness/mass ratio.
